This is a 3 vs 3 battler. Each participant is randomly generated, with your team in the top row and the AI opponent’s on the bottom. Each unit has a starting ATK of 4 and 20 HP.

Game flow:
    • Each unit can take one of three actions: Guard, Attack or Support.
        ◦ Guard: Halve damage AND healing received for this turn.
        ◦ Attack: Select a target on either side and calculate damage.
        ◦ Support: Select a target on either side and change its state determined by attributes.
    • Once you have selected an action for all available units on your side, click Finalize to automatically conduct these and the opponent’s actions in the following order:
        ◦ Guard → Support → Attack
        ◦ If multiple units perform the same action (e.g. Support), these will occur in a random order.

Attribute System:
The attributes are based on the Wuxing (Five Phases/ Agents) of Chinese Philosophy. Based on their respective attributes, two units can have one of the following interactions:
    • Neutral/ N (e.g. Wood acts on Wood)
    • User is Generative/ UG (e.g. Wood acts on Fire)
    • User is Destructive/ UD (e.g. Wood acts on Earth)
    • Target is Generative/ TG (e.g. Wood acts on Water)
    • Target is Destructive/ TD (e.g. Wood acts on Metal)
